# Buffer Overflow Guide
This is a Bufferflow Guide, inspired by TheCyberMentor's Buffer Overflow tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSnPayW6F7U&list=PLLKT__MCUeix3O0DPbmuaRuR_4Hxo4m3G 

# Background:
This repository is meant to be supplemental information based on TheCyberMentor's walkthrough. I created this guide with the intent to provide step-by-step written instructions, and hopefully provide greater insight or additional confidence in your pursuit to learn this technique. I believe that notetaking can be a difficult for many individuals, therefore the goal of this repository is to consolidate steps into a reference sheet, and provide the scripts used in TheCyberMentor's video series. All credit for the scripts go to TheCyberMentor. The only changes I made to the scripts were morale-building naming conventions and providing an additional script for Linux buffer-overflows. Additionally, I included some notes on observed issues for quick reference. The beauty of this repository is that it can be cloned to your linux machine (removing the need for manually typing out python scripts), and utilized as a reference if you forget any of the steps in TheCyberMentor's Walkthrough.
